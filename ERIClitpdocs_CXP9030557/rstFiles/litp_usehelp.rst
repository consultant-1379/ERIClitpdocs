This page describes how to use the LITP documentation.

***********************
Available Documentation
***********************

The LITP documentation includes:

- Information for Plugin Developers (:ref:`litp-sdk`)
- Information for REST Developers (:ref:`rest-api`)
- :ref:`litp-users`

The home page provides information about the documentation available in each of these categories, plus references to pages with more information on each.

************************
Documentation Navigation
************************

To navigate the documentation, you can use the following features:

- Hyperlinks are used to cross-reference other topics in the documentation. 
  Click a hyperlink to view the referenced material. In the LITP documentation, hyperlinks usually changes to red, underlined text when you pass your mouse cursor over them.
- The navigation panel on the left-hand side of the screen includes the following items:
	- A dynamic *Table Of Contents*, that includes the current page and its sub-pages/sections. All page/section titles in the table of contents are hyperlinks to the relevant location in the documentation.
	- Links to the *Previous topic* and *Next topic* at the same hierarchical level as the current topic.
	- A *Quick search* field. Enter a search term and click **Go** to see a list of documentation topics containing that term. Click a topic title in the search results to view that topic.
- The navigation bar at the top of the screen includes:
	- Breadcrumbs that show the hierarchical drill-down to the current topic, with topics separated by >>s. Each item in the breadcrumbs is a hyperlink to the associated topic: click a hyperlink to return to that section.
	- **previous** and **next** links. Click to go to the previous/next topic in the documentation. To return to the last page you were looking at (which may not be the previous page in the overall document structure), use your browser's **Back** button.
	- **index** link. Click to view an index for the documentation. Index terms are hyperlinked to the topics containing those terms.
